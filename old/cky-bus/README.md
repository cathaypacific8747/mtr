# cky-bus

Quick website to allow myself to check bus times at CKY easier.

This project currently uses the [Halfmoon](https://www.gethalfmoon.com/) framework, with vanilla JS and some jQuery.
Since this is only a very early proof-of-concept, there are plans of migrating this towards React.

Feel free to contribute!
